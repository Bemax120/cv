        <p class="p1"> Congress, state legislatures, and city and county councils are all exploring programs and policies to keep small businesses afloat. The greatest need that local, independently owned businesses have right now is cash flow. Ask your local, state, and federal legislators to act quickly to provide relief to small businesses in the form of grants; low- or no-interest, deferred-repayment loans; moratoriums on eviction and late fees; property tax deferment; and financial assistance and healthcare for small business staff. Dozens of towns and cities have moved quickly to create emergency grant programs for small businesses to help them meet payroll and cover expenses such as rent and utilities. Encourage your town or city council to do the same. </p>
