                            At CSAA Insurance Group we provide grants to nonprofits across the country and support employees with their own involvement through volunteerism and giving programs. Over the years we have built a pro bono volunteerism program that connects HR, Marketing, and Legal expertise to nonprofit partners. In response to COVID-19, we connected our café staff to provide meals to local nonprofits. We continuously seek to leverage all our assets to do good in our communities.

Additionally, when we launched Smartsheet Cares, our corporate giving platform, later in the summer, we did so with a 2:1 matching campaign (up to US$150,000) for additional employee-nominated organizations in support of Black Americans. We also offer discounted pricing to nonprofits interested in using Smartsheet for their organizations.

                            Community is the heart of Hollister. It’s our compass and it is what fueled Kip’s, our CEO’s, passion for founding the business 32 years ago. This past year, we focused on co-creating the programs that are part of RecoveryWorks – a non-profit program at Massachusetts General Hospital, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School, dedicated to connecting individuals who have substance use disorders with employment opportunities and matching their level of experience and skill sets. When COVID-19 hit Boston in March, we developed a series of virtual programs – free of charge – designed to support our community, bring leaders together, and enhance and deepen human connection. We developed over 16 program offerings offered in excess of 65 free sessions via Zoom with over 750 registrations, including weekly guided meditations led by Kip. Kip also started a podcast during this time, Well Being Walks, that is accessible through multiple channels.
